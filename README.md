# ContactPoint identifier OCDS Extension

[OCDS extensions](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/extensions/) can be used to declare additional fields, objects and sections that will be included in an OCDS file, but which are not in the core schema, and to add or extend codelists. When any OCDS publication cites an extension in its' package metadata, it should be validated against the schema with that extension applied.
